PvrTcCompressor
===============

This was an afternoon project to determine whether crude approximations could
produce reasonable results.

This is *NOT* complete sourcecode. It includes enough code to show the details
of how the algorithm works.

If anyone decides to make this compile separately, send a pull request.
